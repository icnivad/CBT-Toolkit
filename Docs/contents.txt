How can I stop feeling so bad?
Probably what is troubling you most is bad feelings.  You may feel terrible anxiety, or sad, or angry.  These feelings are deeply upsetting.  Unfortunately there is no magic button to make these feelings go away.  You can't make yourself feel a certain way.  You feel what you feel.

So what can you do?  
You might not be able to change your feelings instantly, but you can still affect them.  There are two things you do have some control over, thoughts and behaviors.  

Why record your thoughts?
