	<p><strong>CBT</strong>, short for <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</strong>, is one of the most effective treatments for people with anxiety or depression.  CBT provides you with <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>practical</strong> techniques for <strong>coping</strong> with <strong>negative thoughts</strong>, and altering <strong>maladaptive behaviors</strong>.  The treatment is designed to be <strong>time-limited</strong> - most patients meet with their therapist between 12 and 16 times as they learn to apply CBT techniques effectively.  During treatment, homework is frequently assigned so that you can apply what you have learned in therapy.  In particular, your therapist may ask you to keep a record of your thoughts so that you can practice <strong>challenging negative and distorted thoughts</strong>.  You may also be asked to keep track of your daily activities, so that you can see how your mood is affected by your behaviors. <strong>This is where the Mood Toolkit comes in.</strong> The Mood Toolkit will allow you to easily <strong>keep track of your thoughts</strong> and <strong>daily activities</strong>. The web application will include both a <strong>thought diary</strong> and an <strong>activity diary</strong>, which will allow you to easily monitor the progress of your treatment.</p>

	<p>My name is Ben Earle and I'm the creator and developer of the Mood Toolkit. 
	I've suffered from depression and anxiety since high school.  
	I've been lucky enough to have the support of wonderful friends and family who have helped me through some difficult times.  Now I'd like to pay it forward by creating a tool that can help other people who struggle with these illnesses.  
	I've found the methods of CBT extremely useful in my own life, when coping with setbacks and negative emotions, and I'd like to help make these tools available to others.
